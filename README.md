Implementing the card game "Rummy"

This version runs either in the terminal as a text based simulation or through JavaFX in an interactive GUI.
- The Text Based Simulation can be run with the main function in GameSimulator.java and runs in pure Java
- The GUI requires JavaFX to be installed and configured. To run this in VS Code, configure it to connect in launch.json and in settings.json as already laid out, then run the main function in the GUI.java file.
